__label__-1 "i received this as a gift . it is a very pretty top but the material is sooo delicate that the cutout areas were torn in many spots and where it was n't torn completely you could see it fraying . the sales associate said they get many returns on this item ."
__label__0 "oh wow no . as the previous reviewer said much lighter than the picture ! rise and inseam are as described but with the light denim they combined to make a bad look for this 40something . maybe for a younger audience who like the 90s retro vibe ? the fit is true to size i tried the 27 and it was a nice snug fit around the bum ( waist 28/29 hips 36 usually a 27 or 28 in jeans sometimes even a 29 if they 're super skinny ) ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this top but when i received the picture on the website is a dark charcoal almost black and the grey that you order is much much lighter grey . in addition this shirt is super boxy ... thus why the model probably is pinning her elbows to her side to bring the top in . going back disappointed ."
__label__-1 "i 'm so bummed ! i absolutely loved the pair of these i bought in the bronze color great fit great color so comfortable ! however i just washed them and could tell right away when i laid them flat to dry that they had lost color in areas where they had wrinkled in the wash machine . so now they have strange lighter lines running along them . not acceptable . i will say that the two lighter colors may not have this issue . for reference see my stats . i bought a 26 ."
__label__1 "so i love this top . i got it in black and red . both are amazing and go with about anything . they run a bit large . i sort of forgot to read the label and thought it was just a cotton turtleneck . i threw it in the washer on regular settings and cold water and hung it to dry . i would say it shrunk 10 % at most . beyond that no difference . in fact it fits better after it shrank since it was a bit big . obviously if you do not dry clean this you are going against manufacturer recommendations but i"
__label__0 "i loved the color and lines of this jumpsuit but found it to be far too short in the torso . ( and about 8 too long in the leg but that 's a lot easier to fix . ) i tried sizing up but it still was n't working for me . i 'm only 5 ' 7 and while i 'm long-waisted i can usually make jumpsuits work . if you have a short torso and long legs this is a beautiful option . otherwise i ca n't recommend it ."

__label__-1 "this is more of an undershirt than a shirt . the material is very very thin and it shows everything . it was beyond unflattering on me . do n't buy this unless you have a knockout thin body ."
__label__0 "this top is cute but i found issues with both the fit and the quality . i tried on an xs but found it to be boxy on my petite frame ( 5 ' 2 110 lbs 34a ) . even worse though was the feel of this shirt . it 's not lined so you can feel every bit of the beautiful stitching on your skin . it was so itchy and i only wore it for a minute in the fitting room . it 's a pretty shirt but not worth actually wearing ."
__label__0 "this dress looked amazing in the picture . i am 5'10 and since the model was 5 ' 9 with the dress dragging on the ground i assumed it would be long on me as well . even with flats this dress is an awkward length . the description says it is 62 in length but i measured it and the dress i got was 52. i will say that it 's a beautiful fabric and the quality of the dress is great . it just does n't look like the dress in the picture at all in terms of the way it hangs and the length ."
__label__1 "woke up this morning to an email from retailer showcasing this gorgeous jacket . i knew i had to have it . trying it on in the store it did not disappoint ! hei hei is a really wonderful brand and me being a more plus sized gal their sizing is always wonderful . i normally do an xl in most retailer jackets and tops .. but i was able to do a l well . the arms have plenty of room and the body of the jacket has a room as well ( like your typical bomber would ) . the fabric is soft and the blush color"
__label__0 "nice soft jeans cute style and i wish i could keep them ... they just are too small on me . : / not sure if i 've gained weight ( which i do n't think i have because i had on a size 28 pair of pants today ) but i ordered a size 29 in these jeans and they zipped but just too snug around the waist . i would honestly need a 30 or 31. looks like they are selling out quickly so i doubt i 'll be able to get the size i need . if you have a small waist i think they would be fine but they do n't fit my body type"
__label__1 "i love wearing this . it is a little slice of summer which i am desperately hanging on to . the color pops it 's so very comfortable & the back is a work of art ! can be dressed up with a pencil summer skirt or down with capri style pants ."
__label__-1 "this is a very lovely looking sweater . unfortunately it runs incredibly small . i 'm only 5 ' 3 and the size small hit me above my mid-rise jeans . it does n't fit at all how it 's shown on the model . it 's also a very delicate fabric . seems like it would snag easily . i was really hoping it would work as i used my birthday discount to purchase it but i 'm sending it back ."
__label__1 "really like the quality color and overall design of these jeans . they ran a little long on me but i just cut off an inch from the bottom and they fit perfectly with some tall booties . i did n't need to get them altered because the design of them is that they are cut at the bottom and are a little frayed . so glad that was the case given the price tag on them . i am 5 ' 7 128 lbs and wear a size 28 which fit perfectly except for the length which was easily fixed . definitely recommend these jeans"

__label__0 "i really wanted this jumpsuit to be my holiday staple ! i ordered this jumpsuit in a sz 4 ( my typical size ) - the jumpsuit does n't have a waist i suppose the ribbon created the illusion of a waist . most jumpsuits are super slimming because of having a waistband and this does not besides the bow . also what i found strange is the back zipper goes all the way down passed your bottom - it 's the longest zipper i 've ever seen . it 's very body hugging so it shows your curves if you have any . i will sadl"
__label__0 "just a heads up - this is a romper - pants and not a dress ! you ca n't tell from the pictures . i ordered thinking it was a dress but it 's actually ... culottes ? i 'm not sure what you would call it . the pull on styling was awkward and the sash was bulky . it definitely goes back !"
__label__-1 "i was really excited for this jacket to arrive but it 's going back . because the fabric is coated it does not drape or hang nicely at all . i expected it to be boxy but it sticks out so oddly in every direction that it looks horrible . i 'm usually an xs and ordered an xs and it looks ridiculous on me ."
__label__0 "the dress has a flattering cut and is a nice color . but the fabric looks like old matted carpet . i will be returning ."
__label__1 "this dress fits well and the material allows for hiding lumps and bumps . material is heavy yet soft . i could see wearing it with sneakers as the model is or dressing it up with jewelry and heels . this will be a perfect dress to take on vacation as it wo n't get wrinkled and it is so versatile . i 'm normally a size 4-8 depending on clothing item and i bought this in a size small . fits perfect . for reference i am 38-26-38 ."

__label__-1 "first let me say i love the fabric and the pattern of the blue dress . but the fit is extremely loose . they could take out an entire 12 inches of material and it would still be a swing dress . the photo of the back of the model where the blue dress goes in to her waist is not at all accurate . if it was i would love this dress . the photo of the model wearing the other color is how the dress actually hangs - straight down from the underarms and then bigger as it goes toward the hemline . i am 5 ' 7"
__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this dress but it was not right for me . made my curvy body look shapeless . also had a button crack before i even put it on . returned it ."
__label__0 "i like this shirt . it 's quite lovely . i ordered it in mint . it 's nice to have a dressy t-shirt ."
__label__-1 "i loved this t-shirt when i first tried it on : a good cut -- not too drapey or fitted . but then i washed it ( laid flat to dry ) and it shrunk so much that it 's unwearable now . so disappointing ."
__label__-1 "quality is fantastic but i feel like a 14 would have barely made it 's way around one leg ! this pant is way small in terms of sizing and not a style fit for anyone over a 6. a lot of fabric in the legs . nice pant but not for this girl !"
__label__-1 "this is another item i 've been stalking that i thought miraculously made it to sale with my size still available . i ordered online but when it arrived i have to be honest i did n't even try it on because i knew it would be going back . the beautiful print online looks really cheap irl on the flimsy fabric . the beaded detail on neck is basically a low grade sequin trim . so much potential just executed poorly ."
__label__1 "absolutely beautiful and well made . this pair of jeans is perfect no flaws whatsoever . i usually wear size 27 but bought the 26 as it fits better . 27 is very slightly loose but i think it supposed to be like that for a boyfriend jeans . i prefer it nice and fitted so 26 works better . i 'm lucky to find them still available in the store while it 's not online . i did n't hesitate to buy at full price which i rarely did . i 'm so in love with my new purchase . very happy !"

__label__1 "this is a fun sparkly top that was great over the holidays with a sparkly long-sleeved top underneath and will be fun in the summer too . i got a size small since my regular size extra-small was sold out and it was still really cute . great cut and design . as others have mentioned the quality could be slightly better but it 's a good deal if you get it on sale ."
__label__1 "i purchased this dress for my 31st birthday and i am so glad that i did ! i saw it in my local retailer store and immediately had to try it on ! it is very flattering because i am 5 ' 0 usually a size 8 or 10 in dresses and it fit perfect ! the material is light definitely suggest delicate cycle and hang-drying but it is nice because you can layer this dress with a vest or coat ! highly recommend this dress !"

__label__0 "i love the maeve line and was excited to get this dress . unfortunately the fit was just bad . the top fit fine but the bottom half was too snug and there were unattractive gaps around the waist and the pockets . do n't think another size or tailoring would address the issue . for size i am 5 ' 4 130 and ordered the 6 ."

__label__0 "gosh this is beautiful but it is way wider and puffer than i imagined it would be . in fact it almost looks like a costume or something you would buy handmade . i would just feel silly wearing this out to dinner with a group of friends . i gave it high ratings on the quality however because it really is beautiful but the design is just not what i had hoped for ."

__label__0 "i found this dress to run very large . the fabric was substantial but rather coarse . also the lighter color in the pattern is lavender and not white or cream ."

__label__1 "i adore this dress . i bought a little over a month ago and have already worn it many times- rare for me . it is so easy to throw on and yet it 's stylish and flattering- i do n't have the time or energy i used to get dressed up so i love this . when i bought it it was knotted on one side in the front . that 's the only way i wear it now . it just adds something to it and gives it more shape . i 've washed it several times ( laid flat to dry ) and it has held up well . i 'm definitely bookmarking this to buy"
__label__1 "this dress just feels and looks amazing . i love how it is n't too short like a lot of new styles . i think it will be wonderful with leggings or tights in the winter . i also love the plaid cuff detail . the only drawback is the buttons need to be reinforced . i got home and realized one button was missing . i went to the store to swap for a new one and when i went to cuff the arms 2 buttons popped off !"

__label__1 "love this color ! when i saw this beautiful blue color in the store i had to try them on ! so pretty ! if you love pilcro chinos -- you will be happy with these ! same great fit and an awesome color !"
__label__-1 "when i tried this top on i started laughing . the two rows of ruffles are made of a starchy thick cotton which instead of falling by the hips juts out like wings . it 's also huge . cute idea wrong material and placement ."
__label__1 "as others mentioned the arm holes are a bit large- but i did n't find this too much of a problem . possibly that 's because as a smaller chested woman i run into that issue regularly . i 'm 5 ' 4 130 and the size 8 fit perfectly . the length is at the top of knee ."
__label__-1 "this top looked so cute in the picture but unfortunately does n't live up to it ! the one i received actually has the print shown in the photo on the inside of the shirt . it makes it much darker and boring . the shirt itself is on the short side and would 've looked better if it hit lower on the hips there 's just too much fabric for it to land higher than that ."
__label__1 "i saw a review from another petite person who said this runs small but i 'm my case it ran true to size . it 's a very flattering dress and easy to wear for any occasion ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this but instead of being a flowy kimono top as pictured- it was a thick blazer type garment . not at all what is pictured here unfortunately . also it was much shorter than pictured and i am only 5 ' 4 '' . love most retailer styles but this one was a miss and a return ."
__label__0 "the fabric is great quality but it stretches too much around the waist making it look a little awkward . other than that the quality is good ."
__label__1 "this is the softest jacket ! i could sleep in this fabric . the ruched details and fun collar make it unique . plus it has inside pockets ! one of the best finds in a while ."
__label__-1 "does not say ribbed . did not want ribbed . would not have bought ribbed"
__label__1 "this is definitely my go to top for work weekends or night out with the husband . i 've worn it with skinny jeans black tights and skirts . it goes with just about anything . easy to accessorize with a simple long chain necklace or a statement piece . i think the gray combo was a bit more flattering than the green combo ."
__label__-1 "i had high hopes for this top but once again it is just a big boxy too much material top . i get the style but if it adds 10lbs to your middle area its not for me . it is a thin material so it does hang nice ."
__label__-1 "did not work for me . whatsoever . the stripes were adorable but the piece just did n't fit like on the model . the collar was practically choking me and the tie just did n't make my figure look the way it normally does . aka i looked frumpy and chunky which i 'm not . going back ."
__label__0 "this dress pattern and material are great - it 's just way too big . i even tried an xs and it looked like a huge sack on me . too bad it had some real potential ."
__label__-1 "even at a very deep discount this piece is definitely not worth the money . the picture made me think this jacket had a longer curved velvet hem as part of its design ( which would be cool ) -- which is largely what attracted me to it but as i discovered when it arrived that was actually part of the shirt worn beneath in the photo . so this image is rather misleading . the actual jacket is very thin -- more like a shirt with an open front than a jacket . the pockets are just loosely tacked inside . for"
__label__0 "i ordered this skirt hoping i could wear it to work as it looked tailored on the model . this skirt is made from a heavy material but flares out . it is a whole lot of skirt ! i 'm 5 ' 2 and short waisted it looked like i was getting swallowed up . i love the colors and design but it just overwhelmed me . it would work on someone taller ."
__label__0 "the color and design/style are cute but i found this to be too oversized . if you want to layer it then it might be for you but i was hoping for more of a tailored look ."
__label__-1 "i truly can not understand the great reviews on this dress ! i purchased in both a sp and a mp . i am 5 ' 2 120 # . the mp fit perfectly . i definitely would n't keep it though because it looks like someone sewed a bunch of old sweatshirts together . it 's not super soft coarse on the inside and feels old . the back is longer than the front it just looks like something my daughter would make in sewing class out of scraps . even with leggings and great boots it looks worn ."
__label__1 "this hoodie is just what i had hoped it would be ... it is super soft comfortably loose but with the tie bottom hugging the hips and low v-neck - it 's just the right amount of sexy . it will be my go-to this fall and winter !"
__label__1 "i love this vest . get compliments every time i wear it . it 's stretchy too : ) . unfortunately i got ranch dressing on it and spot treated it with shout and now the spot is gone but the color faded there . so little tip do n't spill on it lol . my fault though so still 5 stars !"
__label__0 "this top did not look at all like it did on the model . i thought it would be slightly loose through the hips but instead it was snug on top and very very very loose . great for someone who is pregnant . which i am not . returning ."
__label__0 "i guess i am in a comfort clothing mood these days since i have been looking at a lot of them lately ! this one is a nice thicker material and i like that the sleeves go all the way down but i am not a fan of the design . i felt the color scheme was very plain . the neckline comes up higher on me than i would have expected and makes me feel like i am choking . it is not a flattering cut on me and does not accentuate anything i would want it to nor does it hide imperfections . it truly is comfort we"

__label__1 "this is absolutely beautiful . the picture online does n't do it justice . i slipped this on with skinny jeans in the store and was hooked instantly . fit was a little large . i would have tried a petite but this shirt does n't come in petite sizes . love this !"
__label__-1 "the cut of this piece is great the quality of the fabric is terrible . i used it under another layer the first day i wore it and it pilled across the bust . after hand washing in cold water and hanging to dry it shrank in length- so much that i can no longer even wear it . i always happily pay a premium for quality staple wardrobe pieces . this did n't hold up to one wearing let alone one season . i recommend strongly against it ."
__label__-1 "so much extra fabric . not something i would recommend buying online ."
__label__1 "this skirt is not only cute but really comfy . i really like the materials it 's made of and the way it seems to hug my body in a flattering way . i 'm 5 ' 2 so the only down side is that i wish it came in petite but i still kept it because it looked great hitting me right above my knees and high at my waist . love this skirt !"
__label__-1 "this sweater is so cute and seems high quality . i would love to keep it but it is way too cropped for my taste going down just below my mid section . i wish it had been cut longer- i would have kept it ."
__label__0 "it 's a t-shirt . a very cute print nice cut very soft -- but a t-shirt . therefore why is it almost $ 50 ? ? ? ? tried it on in the store and loved it but i just ca n't justify $ 50 for a t-shirt . for those who will not be deterred by the price : i normally wear about an 8-10 dress size at retailer and the medium fit well ."
__label__0 "i was really looking forward to getting this top but what a disappointment . it is absolutely huge ! i normally wear a large and i think a small would have fit me and a small never fits me . too bad cause it 's such a pretty top . p.s . this has an attached camis ( which i hate ) ."
__label__0 "i ordered a six 6 petite . the pant leg was still very long . and if i have it tailored it will not preserve the whole point of these pants having a flare . this is a slim fit . i have heavy thighs and this was not for me . i 'm 5 ' 120 lbs . also the tag warns that the fabric may leave color on lighter clothing . which i do n't get because it 's spandex blend . also was n't too hip in the zipper on the back ."
__label__0 "the fabric is super soft and the grey is pretty but it is light grey not dark grey as described when you select to buy it . my biggest issue with the top is that the cold shoulder arm reveals the entire arm so if you are n't completely toned with your tricep and all over arm it will show ... which is why i bought this to hide my blunders"
__label__0 "i loved the material 's texture and drape but it was too sheer for me . i am 100 % against having to wear a tank under white tees . ( which means i have a lot of trouble finding any white tees but ... ) other than the see-through nature i loved this shirt !"
__label__-1 "this dress runs so large why did they not make an extra small . the material and detail are great the flow in the back is different but is flattering . i wish wish that they made this in the extra small i was swimming in it there was no way to fix it so it went back"
__label__1 "great fitted tee . nice styling . hard to find tees that are fitted -- they seem to make most of them these days like boxes i suppose because it 's easier to make . this looks great and feels good . true to size . loving it !"
__label__1 "this top is both cute and flattering . it is also soft and the colors are gorgeous . i highly recommend"
__label__0 "saw online and had to have . got it home and i was swimming in it ! i normally am a size l in most retailer brands but this felt so large ! the actual top is lovely with an airy artistic quality to it . not sure if i will go back for the medium or not ."
__label__-1 "it 's a cute idea but it 's so low cut and the material is very thin . i was hoping to wear it as a cool flowing summer top but i 'll have to layer it since my whole bra basically hangs out of it . i 'm only keeping it because it was such a good price . also the buttons are super tiny and a little hard to fasten ."
__label__0 "i ordered a m as the previous review said it ran small . i found it to be very large . i have more curves than the model and also thought it made me look boxy ."
__label__-1 "this vest looked so cute online but it 's a disaster . the quilting is so bulky that the drawstring does n't work properly and it just hangs . itlooks like something out of a costume closet that could be used for a peasant farmhand or a zombie movie . seriously it 's bad ."
__label__-1 "horrible fit . i do not understand why they but a aline dress with a skin non aline camisole under the dress ."
__label__1 "i think it 's a little on the long side and the sleeves are a little tight but otherwise i really like this jacket . it 's lightweight for summer and yet more stylish than the other long sleeve things i grab in case i get cold ."
__label__1 "i just received this shirt in the mail and i 'm in love . it is n't your average t-shirt in that it has character and class . i ca n't wait to wear it ! another reviewer was unhappy that the embroidery in blue on the back was n't as dramatic as the picture ; i 'm not seeing it . i think the blue stands out very well . i know i should say hurry and get yours before they 're gone but in truth i 'd rather be the only one with this beautiful shirt ! : )"
__label__-1 "i love deletta and regularly search for their items here on retailer . however this one is a miss as i think it runs small or you need to be taller and thinner then i for the gathering opening to hit you right . i did really like the color ( ordered the brown ) and material but back it goes ."
__label__1 "this is an attractive fitted vest . the tight belt on the back gives it a new look great shape . the fabric is good quality . the neck is tight and high . i usually get a small at retailer but this small is way too tight and there is no way you could put a sweater under which you usually do in weather cool enough for a vest . judging from the photo i would guess she is an extra small wearing a small or medium . it looks good with taupe or brown pants/jeans"
__label__0 "the picture makes it looks like it has rich brown yellow and orange colors . when it came it was more black with some orange that popped . much different then i expected . the material was nice and silky but i was not willing to keep something that was dry clean only . i sent it back ."
__label__-1 "maybe it 's my curves or the way i 'm only 5 ' 4 but this was a hot mess on me ! it is soooo long and cut to low for my 36d chest . it is slim and the cut usually is flattering but somehow this dress was anything but ! it is really shiny and the material is heavier than anticipated for warm weather . if you are super tall and skinny with no boobs go for it ! had to send back !"
__label__1 "this dress is absolutely stunning and well made . it can be worn throughout the seasons . i love this designer and this dress is a masterpiece ."
__label__-1 "this dress is really nice and lightweight . the slip is snug so the outer part floats nicely . but .. it adds a bit too much volume if you have a lot of curves . it disguises in a way but also is a bit less flattering . i really wanted to like it because it 's so breezy but a tad matronly on me ."
__label__1 "great rather heavyweight long cardi . i purchased the blue which is a lovely shade of gray/blue not quite as bright as the picture depicts . pin is adorable ; doubt i 'll ever use it to close the sweater but still a nice touch . for reference i 'm 5 ' 5 136 lbs 34ddd and typically fall between size small and medium . took a medium in this one and glad i did . perfect fit . falls exactly like on the model ."
__label__0 "these are really nice pants - color and style are perfect but when i first put them on they seemed like they fit perfectly on me then within 30 minutes they looked 2 sizes too big - they got loose due to the material not being firm or thick enough . i would go down a size for sure . the cons are n't unsolvable so try them out !"
__label__1 "flattering comfortable and a fantastically versatile color and style . if you 'd like the garment to fit about how it does on the model i 'd say that it 's tts . the picture represents the color accurately - is a very dark slate grey . i 've found that the color is a great neutral - i can wear it with other neutrals or with colors as featured on the model . the style is also really versatile - i can wear it as a stand-alone t-shirt or under a blazer to work . i 've washed the garment once on the"
__label__1 "i tried this on at the store in the regular size it came in and thought maybe it has some potential is i ordered it for me in a petite since that 's what i am . i ignored the package when i first got it thinking it would n't really look right but omg it 's 100 % amazing and flattering . wear it with skinny jeans leggings jeggings whatever and it 's just super awesome on dressed up or down . i 'd buy this over and over again without a doubt ."
__label__0 "i tried on this shirt in the small and the xxs - both were ridiculously wide . they were also both cut really short - the peplum basically started right below my boobs though the small was maybe a little bit longer than the eex . the stripes are really cute the cut is just very strange . for reference the black and white is the small the taupe is the xxs ."
__label__-1 "i was expecting elbow-to-full-length sleeves and like a previous review noted they were short . very weird look for a wrap . returned ."
__label__1 "great purchase . true to size . so flattering . love it simplicity .. buy it if you enjoy compliments !"
__label__0 "this vest looked so cute online . what you ca n't see however is the vertical seaming under the arms does not have any fringe ( about 3 wide ) . that material in the seaming area looked like cheap polyester and it pulled slightly near the side pockets so it did n't lay nicely . also the top of the vest where it comes together also does not lay well and it falls awkwardly open - again showing the cheapy material that it 's lined with . fits true to size . i usually wear a s/m in retailer and purchased the"
__label__1 "beautiful and comfy ! ! ! ! love it !"
__label__-1 "runs very large and way too much fabric . i wanted this top to work because it looks cute on hanger . i usually wear s/m and the xs had too much fabric . may work better on someone with longer torso and taller . i am 5 ' 6.5 36c 126lbs"
__label__-1 "i went with my usual size but it is too tight it fits but i would feel uncomfortable in it . i ordered the pink one which looks nice in the picture but in person it looks cheap . the beading at the neckline immediately looked to me like cocktail dresses my grandma used to wear in the 1970s . that beaded neckline added to the cheap look . this one is not for me ."
__label__1 "being six feet tall i 'm always combing reviews for the opinions of other tall women and i 'm glad i did on this one ! with the off the shoulder look you can sometimes gain extra length and it 's true in this case . i stayed tts because of length issues and while it is billowy it 's not horribly so . i would think however if you 're between sizes or not worried about height i 'd go with the smaller option . adorable comfy casual while being dressy enough for a night out !"
__label__1 "true to size so great fit from top to bottom . i am 5 ' 5 '' and it hits my hips at just the right spot - not too high or too low . it also does not flare out too much so it will not give off the impression that you have something to hide in the tummy area . it is very soft and comfortable . the material is not fragile so it should be easy to maintain its shape after washing ."
__label__0 "i so wanted to love this but was underwhelmed - ii am tall but yet it hit below my knee in that awkward spot that is just a tad too long to be hip stylish and too short to be evening cocktail - just felt / looked frumpy ... i do think it looks great on other reviewers though so may just be that if was n't a good fit for my body type - i wore my normal size 6 and it just did n't flatter - made me feel 10 years older"
__label__1 "beautiful white denim pants . the fit is perfect . fitted on the top with a nice flare on the bottom . very classy and versatile cut . paige denim runs long for me and these are no exception . will be getting them hemmed but i do n't mind because they are perfect !"
__label__0 "i finally ordered this at this incredible mark downed price ... but i see why . it is cute but serious size issues i have a bust but smaller everywhere else but i did order up because of it being a jumpsuit ... i would have needed 6 more to even zip the top part ! i have many trendy jumpsuits in my closet and this is a first ! if you are flat chested you may want to try at this great price as it would be a great piece for sitting by the fireside next fall/winter ... never too soon to plan ahead !"

__label__-1 "the fit is not as shown on the website . will be returning ."
__label__0 "this vest was of excellent weight but it had very little style . it was like a giant piece of felt was cut out with little thought to design or nuance . not for me ."
__label__0 "online this dress looks so perfect but in person it 's a bit dowdy and unflattering at least on me . i 'm a size 4 with curves and i was hoping it would enhance my waist and flatter my figure . but sadly it was too large on the waist and too poofy in the skirt so it just did nothing for me . i considered sizing down to a 2 so that the waist would fit but the skirt still has too much fabric making my hips look large . so much potential but missed the mark for me ."
__label__-1 "it 's a rather boring tank . i thought it 'd be perfect under a cardigan for work but decided against it . the fit is boxy and does not look good on a girl with curves ."
__label__-1 "this jumpsuit looked so great on the model and looked so hideous on me . i 'm 5 ' 4 and in great shape and this jumpsuit looked absolutely ridiculous .... not to mention it rode right up my backside in the worst possible way . i 'm so disappointed !"
__label__-1 "i loved the look of this sweater on-line but it just did n't work for me . the fit was n't good enough . the style okay . the color fine . the feel scratchy . overall it did not work for my body ."

__label__1 "great alternative to yoga pants these pants are stylish and on-trend but also easy going . dress them up or throw on a hoodie and your look is instantly transformed with very little effort !"
__label__-1 "the colors are vivid and perfectly autumnal but the fit is a mess . it was overall too large the waistline curves up in the front and then falls into small pleats which was maternityish the waistband was thicker than the dress and sat away from my body and the material was a cheapish poly . had the outer dress been made from the same material as the lining i would have liked it better . the modesty closure was a plus but the dress was already unraveling when i took it out . # returned"
__label__1 "love the way this tee looks and feels . so comfortable and fun ! good length . perfect jeans tee ."
__label__0 "this skirt runs very large -- even in the petite line . there was also no shape to the skirt ( at least as it looked on my body ) . the color was nice ( in the pink-grapeish hue ) but ultimately the skirt just looked like a tent on my body ( 00p ) ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited about this top and so disappointed when it arrived today . the lace part is lovely but the skirt part is a crinoline type fabric that balloons out at the sides . it is gathered at the sides rather than pleated and there is no way to get it to lay flat . the back center section is pleated . why could n't they have had the pleats all around ? this will be going back with much regret ."
__label__0 "i loved the rich navy blue color with the accent pockets . the fabric was a nice weight not too thin like lots of retailer tops . i liked the top from the front however the back was way too long especially with the looseness of the style . it would have been much better if it were not so much longer in the back and maybe a little more fitted . it might work on someone taller . i 'm 5 ' 3 and 120 lbs . and i tried xs ."
__label__1 "i bought this as a gift for a friend that is getting married in a few months . it 's so soft and cozy i 'm tempted to keep it ! i got the xs/s regular in white and was worried it would be too long but hits my natural waist ( belly button ) and i 've got a shorter torso and am 5 ' 4.5 . i got this during the 40 % sweater sale and feel it is worth the full price . a fun piece but not one to keep you warm on a cold night more of a cab to curb piece ."
__label__0 "ordered this in xl- i usually am between l and xl . i 'm 5 ' 9 and thought it was cropped boxy and billowy around the midsection that was not flattering . the fabric is light and is less like a blazer more like a cardigan ."
__label__0 "the colors are beautiful and the fabric is very soft and comfortable . i will be returning because of issues with length and being low cut . for reference i am 5 ' 5 145lbs 38-30-40 34ddd . the dress was low cut and showed too much cleavage for my comfort but this may not be an issue for women with smaller breasts ( or if you do n't mind some cleavage showing ) . this length was also a bit too long so if you are 5 ' 5 or shorter you may want to order the petite size ."
__label__-1 "i drooled over this dress online so could n't pass up trying it on at my local retailer store . while i loved the unique color in person & the drape of the skirt ( good quality fully lines ) i was so disappointed with the top of this dress ! it 's very tight ill-fitting & just plain ... weird . i ca n't imagine the fit of the top being flattering on anyone regardless of chest size . it 's a shame because otherwise the dress is adorable !"
__label__1 "i love the coziness of this sweater . i do think it is designed for a looser fit but i sized down for a closer fit . the sleeve design is unique and flattering i think kind of of like a cap sleeve would be if you were wearing a long sleeve shirt under it . i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it does shed some but has so many other positive features that i am keeping it and plan to wear it with lighter colors so i do n't need to worry about it . just lovely really love the blue color especially"

__label__1 "i tried this skirt on in the store it fit like a glove ( that does n't happen very often for me ) but could n't find the right top to pair w/ it so i passed on it but when i got home i found the perfect top already in my closet ! so i ordered it online it does n't seem to lay quite as nice as the one i tried on in the store but i 'm keeping it regardless . highly recommended this skirt ! fits tts ."
__label__1 "i bought this top to add some more color and pattern to my summer wardrobe . it is really cute and a flattering cut . i just had a baby so it 's perfect for showing some curves without clinging . if anything i 'd say it maximizes my bustline more than i expected but is still very flattering . i think i 'm still getting used to my new bustline ; ) soft comfy fabric . not too hot . i get compliments when i wear it !"
__label__0 "this dress is such a beautiful color and the fabric is super soft and lovely . it would be stunning on someone with a slim figure but since i 've got curves/an athletic build it simply did not work . too bad because it is such a pretty dress !"

__label__-1 "loved this dress when i tried it on in the store and thought it would be perfect for a casual wedding . unfortunately the day of the wedding the zipper split and i had to wear something else . it fit well but was poorly made . based off other reviews this is n't the first time this has happened with this dress ! not worth the risk at all ."
__label__-1 "maybe it 's because i 'm 40 but this top was underwhelming . i felt like it was a cheap tee with a big obnoxious bow on the back . it does look cute on the model so maybe it 's a younger top . i would have felt silly wearing it ."

__label__1 "i love the contemporary style of this piece but i returned it because the side slits were too high even for a short person like me ( 5 ' 1 ) . but if you do n't mind showing a little skin at the waist when you raise your arms it might work for you . the fabric has a nice texture and the muted colors would mix well with other pieces ."

__label__0 "ok if i had a different body this would be awesome but i have a big butt and meaty thighs so just did not flatter me . although my husband could n't tell that the pants were tugging on me ( thanks to the pattern it does camouflage ) it was uncomfortable . so if you are built like me this is n't the jumpsuit for you . this is a well made garment but there is no give in the butt and thigh area ( hence would not recommend for my thick thighed sisters ) . for reference i am 5 ' 3 and 150 pounds . th"

__label__0 "the top for this suit is great - i 'm pretty small up top so it 's rare that i find a suit that does n't gap . however the bottoms run so small . for reference i 'm a size 0 in dresses and 2/4 in pants . i ordered the xs and s to start both were too small . with high hopes that i could keep this adorable suit ( and well made otherwise ! ) i ordered a size m bottom . they were still small . sadly i 'm giving up and returning . only order this suit if you 're super super tiny on the bottom ."
__label__1 "i wore this to an engagement party and got compliments all night . it is absolutely gorgeous and very slimming ! i got a petite 4 and it fit perfectly . for reference . i am 5 ' 2 and 125 lbs . you ill not regret buying this dress !"

__label__0 "i love the way that this suit looked however i found that it was lacking in support . i was disappointed to discover upon trying it on that it just does not cover my butt . it fit elsewhere just fine but the slim cut up the sides left it a little too revealing for my liking . in addition i found the top to be awkwardly fitting around the chest area . i am a 34b and ordered a small and it seemed to be too baggy at the top ."
__label__1 "i love this shirt except that the hook that keeps it close does n't work a lot outside of that i love it . i typically wear a small or extra small and with this shirt the extra small was perfect ."
__label__-1 "i ordered the top from a store to have it shipped . it is very pretty but once on it fit the wrong way . i got a small because i know that this designer tends to run tight across the bust . the shoulder was too rounded for this neck line . sleeves should have been either longer or sleeveless . the empire waist even on a smaller busted woman like myself was cut too high ."
__label__-1 "this is the widest sweater i have ever seen . i laughed out loud when i opened it and then showed it around my office and everyone else cracked up too . it is comically wide . even when i was 9-1/2 months pregnant the m/l would have been pretty roomy on me . now that i 'm back to about a size 10-12 this looks like jared from subway 's pre-weight-loss pants in sweater form . ridiculous !"
__label__0 "this is a very cute designed shirt but it fits very boxy and runs large"
__label__1 "i ordered this top in xs and blue its subtle but pretty on as the style gives it a boost . it is a bit snug in the shoulders ( cut a little snug in armpit ? ) but i would not want it larger . it does not affect the appearance is not uncomfortable just noticeable when moving arms around . nice fall top want to try with blue or white jeans and boots ."
__label__0 "i usually wear petite which this was not so a little big for me . but nice color and good quality but pricey for what it is . it 's more like a $ 45 sweater not $ 100+"

__label__0 "i was excited to see this top on sale as i had been watching it for a few weeks . unfortunately i was very disappointed when i received it . it is as a previous person said very much like a pajama top . it is very loose and boxy and in my opinion did not flatter my shape at all . sadly i will be returning it . i would not recommend this top to a person who is athletic or straight and slender as you suggest ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this online and was disappointed when it arrived . it did n't look quite like it does in the photos online . it also runs small . i returned it because i did not feel it was worth the high price ."
__label__1 "no size fit me . i 'm normally a s to m. the small had huge armholes on me and the xs was just a wee bit off somehow . perhaps in length . so i ended up without it sadly . it 's really a very nice top and great quality . i was unhappy to leave it behind ."
__label__1 "saw this top online and hoped for the best . my hopes were rewarded ! lovely lightweight summery top but i think with a cardigan it could be worn in the fall also . i asked 4 friends if they liked it and they all agreed it was very flattering so i decided it was a keeper . have worn it three times since purchasing and have received lots of compliments ."
__label__0 "love the cut and the way they drape . size 26 and 5 ' 6 135lbs fit great until you wear them for an hour . all of a sudden my 26s became 28s . they were practically falling off . i plan to wash them to see if they shrink . i wish they held their shape since they are so cute ."
__label__0 "dress is very pretty but very short almost tunic length ."
__label__0 "i liked the concept of this vest but when i tried it on i felt like i was 9 years old again and wearing my brownies girl scout uniform . it was also very boxy and wide . it seemed to be well-made though and maybe would have worked if it were a different color ."

__label__-1 "runs small . i 'm usually a size sm for retailer clothing ( for reference i 'm 5 ' 4 129lbs 36b ) . the tie around the waist of this dress is not a functional tie that you can relax a bit to give yourself more room around the waist . i could not fasten the buttons to close the dress on the size 8. the size 10 fit enough to fasten the buttons but there was a lot of extra fabric and the arm holes were very large . pretty vibrant colors but size up and be warned of the large armholes ."
__label__0 "this sweater caught my eye and the positive reviews and pre-holiday sale had me try it . loved the color and cut but surprisingly not the embroidery . i felt like i 'd wear it a couple of times and then tire of it . my husband and daughter both said meh so back it went ."
__label__-1 "i really loved this top . however i could n't get it on . i tried on a medium ( my usual size . ) it 's not that it was too small . something else is wrong with it . the large was way too big . too bad i really wanted this look ."
__label__-1 "much lower quality than other robes i have purchased"
__label__0 "this is really a cute top nice fabric the print ( the version i bought ) is lovely though the colors are different than pictured . the problem for me is that i am 5 ' 8 36b with a longer torso and the proportions were just wrong on my body . the blouse does not have much shape at all and fell a bit too short for my liking especially in the front . it hit at hip level as in photo but would look so much better if it had been a couple inches longer . looking at the other reviews i see that most of t"

__label__0 "i am a true size small and i ordered this dress and it was way big . it 's meant to be a relaxed fit but it sagged under the arm-holes because the bust was way too big . some folks are saying it ran small and they are essentially the same measurements as me so it makes me think there is possibly some variation in each size . i got on here to reorder in a smaller size but now am not sure what to do as i need a dress with in the next three days !"
__label__1 "this jacket is well-made and smart looking . it gave me just the boost i needed today at a difficult meeting . thank you retailer !"
__label__-1 "this is huge . i thought it would be oversize but with a bit of shape . there is no shape to this and is a lot of material . i ordered an xs and typically wear an xs or s in blouses sometimes medium in sweaters . it seamed like 2 sizes too big . the material is very soft and the collar is nice . there is a ribbon tie at the waist . the tie is wimpy and could be nicer . when tied there is so much fabric the is gathers and looks like i have no waist ."
__label__1 "i love this dress ! the beading gives it something special and the petite fits my 5 frame perfectly . lightweight enough to wear now and again later with layers for fall . very soft fabric !"
__label__-1 "this is such a beautiful dress . but have to return for the reasons others have noted . the chest does not fit well ."
__label__1 "flattering ! i love how it looks like a maxi dress . fits me perfectly !"

__label__-1 "i loved this skirt . so flattering and such a beautiful fabric . unfortunately after only 2 wears the waistband stretched out so much that it was falling off me ( literally ) . i bought the right size and it was not too tight . the waist band material simply lost its stretch very quickly . very disappointing ."
__label__0 "this shirt is really cute but a little stiff . it does come with a slip but the slip was tight but the shirt fit maybe even a little big . i used another cami under which was better . i think think the sizing is off in terms of slip vs. the actual shirt . i got it in the store with the 30 % off so it was a good deal . it does stretch out as you wear it so it will get bigger and it did make me look a little bigger but still cute on and for a summer shirt it 's thin so it does work well in that r"

__label__1 "absolutely love this top ! i 've been on the lookout for a cute cotton top something that 'd be ideal for summertime . this beautiful piece does n't disappoint . the color pairing - white cotton base and lovely red thread embroidery - looks stunning . not the mention the unique back detailing makes it a must-have . highly recommend ."

__label__-1 "totally see through ."
__label__-1 "i ordered these along with the regular ag stevie jeans and there is a definite difference in fabiric and cut . i liked the darker fabric but it was thinner and stretchier that the more denim version . the cut was also looser in the thigh and seat area which made for a looser less flattering fit . returned it and kept the regular ag stevie ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this skirt in a size small and when i received it not only was it too long but there was also a hole in it . so i returned it . when a small petite became available i ordered it thinking it would fit better . i just received it and there is a hole in this skirt as well . both skirts also looked as if they had been worn ; there was fuzz and lint all over the skirts . i like the skirt but i either have extremely bad luck or it 's really bad quality ."
__label__-1 "while i love the fabric and the pattern this skirt leaves too much to be desired . the full price is absurd considering what you get . there is no mention online that there is no built in slip and as the material is extremely thin a slip is an absolute must .

__label__0 "i 'm 5 ' 9 and these run true to size for the fit but having long legs by the end of the day they start to sag down in the crotch and hit me about mid calf straight out is the package . they wash up perfectly and are cozy . if you 're of average height these will probably be your favorite ."
__label__0 "so i have n't actually tried this and i 'm sorry for the misleading star rating . i just wanted to get someone 's attention on the length . the photos show the dress draping with almost a train even with the model in platform heels but in the video the dress is about 2 inches off the floor . is it the model in the video that is extra tall ? someone help me out . this looks gorgeous but since it 's an online exclusive i wo n't be able to try it on at the store ."
__label__1 "since several reviews said that this dress ran small online i decided to go to my local retailer store to try this on in person . i am 56 120 lbs . and normally a 0 or 2. the 2 worked perfectly . i loved the red version online but thought the green was better for me in person ( the red is a tomato red and was more overpowering on my fair skin ) . the green also has light blue in the detail print so maybe good if you have blue eyes . no problems with the zippers on the ones i tried at the store ."
__label__1 "what a great shirt . however none of the ones i saw in store are colored like the picture . the front of them are all a deep blue color no tie-dyed effect or whatever you 're seeing on the online pics . the shirt runs large . i am an 8/10 38c and the smaller size was plenty big . i ca n't imagine how the larger size would have looked ! i think this top will go with many things including as a cover up over dresses ."
__label__0 "the pattern and fabric on this dress are very nice . there is just too much fabric . it 's much too baggy but could make a nice maternity dress . i 'll be returning it ."

__label__1 "i fell in love with this piece the moment i saw it . unfort they were out of the s so i went with a medium . fortunately for me this piece runs true to size and so while slightly large i will still keep it . the material is sturdy and of good quality the buttons are large and noticeable and the ties by the shoulder are not flimsy . great piece !"
__label__0 "i am normally a size 8 in dresses and bought this in a small . so if you are a smaller person this would likely be a bit loose on you . the color was odd . i liked the navy blue but the pink was a pepto bismol colored pink . i just felt like i would get sick of the color/pattern after one wear . the fit is cute and comfy ."
__label__-1 "i was debating getting a large in this top but went for the medium boy is it huge the jersey fabric is quite thick which makes the sleeves bulky and uncomfortable even the small would be giant ! for reference i normally wear a size 8/10 my chest is 34 e and this was just so so huge it hung so badly of my chest that it looked frumpy and made me look bigger than i am . the colours are true and nice and vibrant ... definitely size down with this one"

__label__0 "there were no reviews when i ordered this tunic so nothing to help gauge fit . it is very cute but the fit is strange - very narrow in the shoulders and chest ."

__label__0 "i ordered the geometric blue/red pattern in a small regular . the material was soft and comfortable . it is a stand-out piece but unfortunately it made my stomach look like it was sticking out too much . the neck line did not stay flat against my chest which resulted in an ill-fitting bunched up look . i returned this one . for reference i 'm 5 ' 4 120lbs 34 a ."

__label__1 "in my opinion the quality and uniqueness of this piece far definitely warrants a full price purchase . adorable cut and style comfortable and cute . it 's the perfect flexible top to wear to work with a skirt or more casually with your favorite pair of jeans . love this !"
__label__0 "absolutely love this blouse but if your a woman cursed with larger arms for your body size than this is not for you . i could n't get the lace part of the upper arms past my elbows . oh well it 's going back !"
__label__1 "this is a really elegant sweater coat -- the faux fur trim adds a lot of flair and the mismatching color blocks on each side keeps things playful . the material is soft and cozy but my one concern is that the threads can get snagged . otherwise though it 's a winner !"
__label__-1 "ordered a l and xl the sleeves were so tight on both sizes but the rest of the shirt was wide and loose . the tight sleeves were not proportional with the rest of the shirt . both sizes had to be returned ."
__label__0 "the front and back of this square sweater are the same and the pattern of the stitching makes it look like it 's on backwards.the lace would be nice but it 's itchy . and the sweater is cropped so i think the layered lace look is odd because the whole thing is so short on the body . the 3/4 sleeves make it look small and fitted but the body shape is bulky . just could n't get it to work ."
__label__-1 "first of all mine arrived in a regular denim shade not the dark wash shown . also the style is more like a blazer and it was huge . i am 5 ' 2 and ordered the petite xs but even xxs would have looked like a baggy blazer . as well the sleeves came barely past my wrists they are designed to cuff as the model has done ? perhaps on someone taller and younger it would look edgy and chic ! the quality is excellent with some nice details . this might be one to try in person if you can ."
__label__1 "walked into the retailer store in new york while on vacation and saw this on display . had to try it on immediately and loved the look . received several compliments from customers in the store . it 's beautifully made soft on the inside and makes a great statement piece that i will enjoy for years to come ! ! you will need to size down cause it runs large . i love it ............"
__label__1 "the fold over is so comfy . not the most flattering but really when you are wearing it you are going for comfort i think . bought these on sale and trying to decide if they are worth it or not"
__label__-1 "i could n't even figure out how to wear this sweater the fit was so odd . the arms cut off short and the seams do n't hit your shoulders where they should . all the extra fabric around the collar is just confusing and unflattering . moving around in it was not easy . i will return this one !"
__label__0 "i tried this in an xxsp . i am normally an ssxp or xsp . it fit me well everywhere except in the crotch where i was given a slight wedgie . not the look i was going for . if i sized up the rest of the jumpsuit would be too large on my frame . also i don ? t feel the quality matched the price point . the one i received had a lot of loose stings already and it was unopened previously . that being said it is a beautiful color and on the right body the style would work well . it just wasn ? t for me ."
__label__-1 "so i have had to return this once so far because the stitching ripped out when i sat down . the little slip thing that goes underneath if cheaply made . i really wish this were just lined dress . i wear it with a blank tank top and leggings underneath . not worth the money but i needed something to wear that was transitional ."
__label__-1 "i love maeve and was so excited for this top which looked like an update from a last season favorite . unfortunately the fabric was stiff it was tight in the chest and went straight down from there . returned ."
__label__-1 "when i returned this the salesperson asked what was wrong w it bc it keeps being returned . i got the black w the white collar/cuffs . i thought it was terribly itchy material ( which could be remedied w a shirt underneath ) but the white collar part was such a dull ugly white-dirty color . maybe the other colors are better ?"
__label__1 "these pants are adorable . i am a petite lady with a small waist and have a hard time finding pants that fit and look good but these do . they are both cute and elegant . and they have pockets . i have had many compliments . the one drawback is they need dry cleaning ."
__label__0 "this is the perfect day dress -- loose fit comfortable fabric . i usually wear a m or l in most dresses of this type but the s actually was the best fit . i have worn it all summer and it 's perfect for hot weather . just order smaller ."
__label__1 "i absolutely love this sweater .... it is perfect for fall"
__label__0 "the blue was a great color and i like the idea of a reversible top . however the xs was just swimming on me . this looks much more fitted in the pictures . my favorite workout top is from this brand and it is fitted and held up for 6 months . where are the fitted tops ? ? i 'll keep looking ."

__label__0 "the print on this dress is really pretty and the styling with the lace is a nice touch . unfortunately it runs quite small in the bust so i had to return it . for someone that is small busted it will be quite cute . everywhere else it is true to size ."
__label__0 "this is beautiful fabric and a good fit but it 's such a pain to get on and off that i just do n't want to hassle with it . the button is in the back and very tricky to reach . too bad because otherwise it 's darling !"
__label__1 "i tried on the xs in store in crimson ( i would need petite ) - the color and fit were very flattering on me ( pale skin ) . the dress feels very silky i love the back how it ties and how high the neckline was on me in the front . the little flutter at the bottom of the dress is also a nice touch . my only concern was whether this looked like a negligee ... i think i would buy it if i had somewhere to go just not sure the fabric is appropriate for work ... reference : 115 lbs 30dd 26.5 in waist ."
__label__0 "bought these for the color however these just did not work for me . the 26 was too small and the 27 was baggy . i 'm 5 ' 3 and typically wear a 26. beautiful color and good denim . if you are looking for a looser fit more of a straight leg fit ... this is a good jean with a fun pop of color ."
__label__1 "this dress hits all of the high notes for me . it is crisp elegant and it looks like something a european coutour designer would create . i am so glad i have this dress in my wrardrobe . it hits me just above the knee which is super flattering . wear this to a fancy party when you want to look feminine and classy . it is a dress that will serve you for a lifetime ."

__label__0 "i tried this jacket on and it was definitely cute but a couple things to note . it 's a wool acrylic blend and it was already starting to pill from being tried on in the store . also it 's unlined . i thought the price point was high given its fibers and unlined . given its hem i wonder how much longevity the piece has and how quickly it might start to look dated too ."

__label__-1 "i was really excited after finding this top online and reading the reviews ; the combination of peplum cap sleeves and color seemed too good to be true . i ordered a size medium but unfortunately this top is on the short side so wearing it with pants or jeans did not work out . in addition the fabric was more sheer than it looks in the picture and the v-neck in front dipped a little lower too . a camisole might have solved both of those problems but i did n't bother . i returned it to the store ."
__label__1 "this sweater is beautiful but is definitely more for looks than warmth . it 's very soft but very thin . i prefer the way it looks open rather than buttoned . i got the moss green color on sale and i am glad i did n't pay full price for it -- it 's lovely but certainly not worth $ 88 ."
__label__-1 "i bought this top in two colors -- i think it 's a really cute easy top to wear but the fabric is extremely thin and poor quality . i tucked the front into a pair of shorts and i can already see a small snag forming which i 'm sure will be a hole in no time . two stars only because i really do like the look of the top generally i just wish it was something that was going to last beyond a couple of wears ."
__label__0 "i think you have to have stick legs/legs for days for this style to fit as pictured . i thought i had found the perfect boyfriend jean but once these babies arrived i was really disappointed . the color is slightly brighter than the picture which is fine though i was digging the slightly greyed look . anyway these were loose in the waist and crotch and fit snugly everywhere else . i have a fairly athletic build so it 's not uncommon for me to have issues with fit around the calves and thighs"

__label__-1 "i fell in love with this cute top however after reading reviews i am going to return it . seems there is a problem with it shrinking after following washing instructions . who wants to dry clean a tank top ? not me sadly . too bad . style was cute and color was awesome ."
__label__-1 "this top really is lovely . i had high hopes of it looking smashing with black jeans . i wash everything before i wear it . though this garment says it needs to be dry cleaned there was nothing so delicate about the fabric that it had to be dry cleaned . so i hand washed it with delicate soap . when the lighter colors came into contact with the black the black immediately stained the light color . i tried putting some stain remover on the black stains rinsed and hung it above my bath tub . it is cur"
__label__-1 "i loved this dress when i saw it online perfect for a summer wedding but when i tried it on i was very disappointed . the fabric and styling are gorgeous and very high quality but the sheer amount of fabric on this dress is just not as pictured . there is layer after layer of silk and ruffle and while lovely it made me look very large . i tried tying the belt many ways to no avail . sadly it will have to go back . it may look good on a very thin frame but did n't complement my average one ."
__label__-1 "according to the label this dress can be hand washed or dry cleaned . i hand washed and line dried per the instructions on the label and all the seams have completely shrunk and gathered . it looks like there 's a drawstring running through every seam . so disappointed in the quality and the labeling . awful ! i gave it one extra star because it 's cute ."

__label__0 "ordered navy in a medium and it is wide . sometimes that 's a good thing but not this time . am short waisted and hoped this would be more fitted at the waist on me but it is n't . it just looked frumpy with lots of see through parts . obviously it needs a cami but was n't attractive on me at all . seemed well made and probably better on someone taller ."
__label__-1 "again bought this while wearing my retailer colored glasses . i loved the flowiness and color of the dark pink and was convinced in the dressing room that this top made me look like a chic goddess mid-vacation on the amalfi coast . i tried it on at home and it straight up looked like i was wearing a maternity top . since i 'm not with child this one 's going back !"
__label__1 "this is the softest shirt super comfy very baggy but i 'd say true to size for the style . it is a bit thin and i 'm worried how it will hold up or would have given the full 5 stars . i 'm not a usual fan of the turtle neck but this is so soft i love it !"

__label__1 "i love this dress . i 'd get it in both colors if i could ! the cut and fit is beautiful i 'd suggest sizing down if you feel like it 's too boxy or lacks shape . the bottom skirt is round enough to where you can twirl ( # 1 thing to look for in a dress ; ) ) and it 's just overall a classic pretty dress . my only complaint is that the overlay cut out seems a little bit delicate and i 'm afraid it will be ruined after a few wears but it seems to be holding up fine so far and is n't incredibly delicate like"

__label__0 "i ordered this dress after seeing it styled with a beautiful cape . when it arrived it was incredibly soft and the color was a pretty muted pink . however once i put it on it clinged to all the wrong places . having a larger chest made it show a lot of cleavage and if i ca n't wear a standard bra with it it 's too complicated . in a regular tank dress it would have been a yes . overall a great dress but probably for another body type ."
