-1,"Sadly  this has to go back. i am 5'5""  128 lbs and this shirt is super short on me. very short. and it's so wide it's almost a trapeze cut. the overall effect is 50s/60s style maternity shirt. which is disappointing because the fabric is beautiful  the detail is nice in person  even the sleeve cuffs are great. i am not very tall and i'm fairly thin on top so i can get away with a lot of styles  loose and tight. the combo of short and trapeze is just unflattering.",Blouses
-1,"I thought this was adorable on the model  but not so much on me. i actually didn't mind it when i tried it on with a long cardigan  but i didn't want to keep it for 1 look. the material felt inexpensive. the shape was very unflattering for an average sized women like myself. i'm 5'8"" and about 160 lbs.",Blouses
-1,The cut of this piece is great  the quality of the fabric is terrible. i used it under another layer the first day i wore it and it pilled across the bust. after hand washing in cold water and hanging to dry it shrank in length- so much that i can no longer even wear it. i always happily pay a premium for quality staple wardrobe pieces. this didn't hold up to one wearing  let alone one season. i recommend strongly against it.,Blouses
-1,I ordered the white and the light blue in size xl. both are cut much smaller than is typical for my other retailer xl blouses. everything the first reviewer wrote is true. the photos of the white top show a detailed back when it is plain (like the blue). the back is just a solid  kind of slippery material. it's strange because it's not see-through in the back but you need to wear a tank/cami for the front. so  it makes the shirt that much tighter since you need to have the extra layer.     i would,Blouses
-1,"I purchase this top of ""what i thought to be a beautiful denim tunic/top"" in a small on the sale rack with additional promo with beautiful details   but what is going on with the mid-section where there is at least 6 inches of space where there is no button or way to close the lower placket! and the lower bottom of placket is sewn shut so it makes the mid section bubble out  but why no buttons to close what would be a button down top???? you can slide your hand through this open space and it ope",Blouses
-1,"I usually wear a medium and bought a small. it fit ok  but had no shape and was not flattering. i love baby doll dresses and tops  but this was a tent. my daughter saw me try it on and said ""that's a piece of tablecloth."" it's going back.",Blouses
-1,I recently purchased this blouse on their 40% off sale in white. i was hoping for a crisp white structured blouse. i did read all the reviews and thought i would give it a try anyway. it is awful. there is no structure or shape but the quality is the reason i am returning. it feels like a napkin or thinner. not even worth the extra sale price. i will be returning.,Blouses
-1,Whatever happened to sizing! pretty print and color but has enough fabric for 2 tops. it is also unlined which is not a huge issue. i wore it with a cami. the arms weren't too gaping for me  thankfully. i tried to make it work with a wide belt but i will have to get it tucked on the sides. i am 140 lbs and got the small. should have gone 1 or even 2 sizes smaller.,Blouses
-1,I agree with the other review. the fabric and pattern are adorable and well made. the fabric is not sheer at all and great quality;however  the shirt is very wide. i am a 34/26/36 and the small is way too big. the arm holes are perfect but the bottom is uncomfortably large and awkward in appearance.,Blouses
0,I'm so disappointed with the fit of this top. it is extremely short  even for my 5'2 frame. sizing up will not fix the length. too bad  because the shirt is cute.,Blouses
0,"I really liked the look of this top online  but when it came i had a couple of issues with it. first  when i tried it on i found the underarms to be a little snug (i normally wear a 10/m  and that's what i ordered). it makes raising my arms tough  and as a teacher  i need to be able to lift my arms above my waist. secondly  my husband's first reaction was that it ""looks like pajamas."" the abstract floral/stripe gets a little lost.  on the other hand  the color palette is very pretty and the qual",Blouses
0,This tunic is way over priced for the style and quality. it fit comfortably (runs a size larger) but it's not really flattering  it jut kind of hangs there looking ok. it is a little too deep of a v cut for a work top as well. this top does not support the price at all. it felt like something i could find at department store for way less. i will be returning it.,Blouses
0,"Love the colors in this top. it's a shame it was so big and baggy i'm not that big a person but really made me look big and frumpy . i am 5'6""  130#. athlete. size small was way too much material for my frame",Blouses
0,First comment about this piece is that it runs unbelievably small  which is not in line with most retailer pieces. i had to size up two sizes to get the size to close  on top of being busty. the material is thin and mildly see thru  but i think the shape it cute and it had a unique look to it with the tiny gold buttons and non-collar top. i decided to keep it.,Blouses
0,This blouse is super cute but oddly sized. i bought a size up and still i squeezed into the top around the bust. the front slit is too low and shows a bit too much cleavage  so this had to go back. i really tried because the fabric is wonderful and the shirt is light and breezy for summer  i just couldn't make it work  .,Blouses
0,I wanted to love this shirt. i like the style  the material is soft but it was so short on me. perhaps i just have a long torso but it fit everywhere else. i wasn't even able to tuck it in because the sides just were so short.,Blouses
0,I love the design of this blouse and the pattern  but the colors are a bit darker than in the photo. the quality is pretty poor. i feel like its a snag away from being ruined and thrown away and for this price it is just not worth the purchase. sending it back :(   it comes with a tank top; just to let others know.,Blouses
0,I liked this top but found it to be a little dowdy. fit was slightly boxy and not a good look for me. may look better on a different body type.,Blouses
1,I fell in love with this top as soon as i tried it on; it's the perfect spring-to-summer top. the fabric is light and airy  and the brown stripes give it a lackadaisical vibe. the little buttons on the back are a cute detail that really give something extra to an otherwise simple top  and the v-neck did not reveal any cleavage. i bought this in a large  and i'd say it runs a little on the larger side  but i like that because it adds to the comfortable  flowy nature of the design. for reference ,Blouses
1,I love this tunic  i wore it with black leggings and boots. it is well made and flowy. i wish it came in more colors.,Blouses
1,"I tried on the petite size in my usual xs  adn i actually have to go down to xxs  i looked overtaken by the shirt. i'm 5'2"" and 115lbs)  cut is flowy and not close to the body  sleeves are narrower  but still ok with athletic built.  color: light one is great for gals with darker complexion and hair  but for my pale self  the darker one was better... but can't go wrong  i ordered both colors and liked both of them.  ruffle is a great addition too...",Blouses
1,"Falls nicely. pretty peachy pink color. darker than pictured. bought sz l  5'8"" 175lbs  am busty. very nice fabric  prone to wrinkles.",Blouses
1,This is beautiful tunic for the spring and summer. great paired with jeans or white denim. runs large and is a true tunic length. very pretty fabric and built in camisole  too. only downside is that it probably needs to be hand washed/line dried to keep it looking like new.,Blouses
1,I just got this top today. the print is just as beautiful in person as it is on the web. it is so incredibly soft and comfortable. i tried it on and it fits just like the photo. i am 5'8 so i can get away with the blousy effect  but  i think that is part of why it is so charming. i think you could dress it up or down really well. i am really pleased.,Blouses
1,I love this top  the detail and embroidery make it great for during the day or at night. the small fits me perfect and i don't wear it with a camisole like some have mentioned  but might if i wore it to work,Blouses
1,This top is great to wear under a blazer when cool or alone on a warm day. i rated it as runs small only because if you are a little busty as i am  it is a little snug across the chest. otherwise fits great.,Blouses
1,This top is feminine and sexy. it can be dressed up or dressed down. i love it and will hold onto it forever.,Blouses
-1,I was very surprised to see such dark blue sequence on this dress. it did not appear as it did on the photo. i was pretty disappointed by the color. the photo of the dress is much more impressive.,Dresses
-1,So disappointed! beautiful dress in the photographs but the cut was incredibly strange. loose and baggy through the top and mid-section but tight around the buttock and thighs.,Dresses
-1,According to the label  this dress can be hand washed or dry cleaned. i hand washed and line dried per the instructions on the label  and all the seams have completely shrunk and gathered. it looks like there's a drawstring running through every seam. so disappointed in the quality and the labeling. awful! i gave it one extra star because it's cute.,Dresses
-1,"I saw this dress worn on the street and thought it was lovely  the perfect work dress. i then found it in the store and my size was already sold out  so i visited another retailer  and another to find it. unfortunately the color blocking on the chest was not very flattering for me  it seemed to overly accentuate it. i am 5'9"" a 36 dd size 12. the colors  the fabric are all wonderful. but this dress is not for me.",Dresses
-1,"The image does not show but the front of the dress has a heavy 24"" utility zipper hidden with 5 snaps. the zipper pull  when closed  sat right on my collarbone  which was he height of discomfort. it felt heavy and awkward. the dress was very high waisted for me (i'm 5'6"" and it was 3"" inches above the navel)) also to the point of discomfort.  an invisible side zipper would have made the difference for me if the proportions were better suited for a non-petite sizing.  the fabric is quite beautifu",Dresses
-1,I have several maeve dresses that fit really well. this was not the case with this dress. fabric and color are great! fit was off especially in top. worst part was zipper that wouldn't move smoothly. took me a good 15 minutes to get it unzipped. such a bummer!,Dresses
-1,I was looking for a dress for playing cello at my friend's wedding. the colors looked perfect  the cut was great  etc. very disappointed to find out how sparkly and scratchy the dress was in person  and sad that the slit came right to my knee  which is a really weird height. sadly returning - might purchase again if it goes on sale and i can't find anything better before the wedding :(,Dresses
-1,Super cute dress online on the model. what you can't tell from the picture is the slip underneath is not true to size of the dress and the outside layer of the dress is more sheer than the picture shows so you can tell the slip underneath is very tight. it might be my body type. otherwise  it's super cute in person and i wish it would've fit better!,Dresses
-1,The design is beautiful but it was thick and too warm for a summer event i was planning on wearing it to.  also  the seam below the chest was uncomfortable.  needed to return,Dresses
0,This dress is the perfect combination of bohemian chic. however  the slip below the dress runs a tad bit small. i have a wide rib cage and normally wear between a 04-06. the dress would have been just perfect if the slip was a bit larger.,Dresses
0,"This has a cute aesthetic on the hanger but not so great on- at least for my body type. i am 5'10"" with broad shoulders and slim  and both the arms and dress length were too short. in addition  the size 8 was boxy and unflattering. sizing down to a 6 would have exacerbated the length issues.",Dresses
0,For reference: 5'3  130#  athletic/muscular body type (broad shoulders  slim hips)  i'm a bit confused on the sizing for this  especially based on other reviews mentioning they needed to size up. i ordered the xs  and i was swimming in it. i usually am quite comfortable in size small  so i'm not sure why the xs was still too big. perhaps you need hips for this dress to work  because it was really just hanging on me and not figure flattering at all. i'm not sure if ordering the xxs would make thi,Dresses
0,"I am 5'4""  100lbs  petite frame  i bought this dress in xxsp. the fabric was good quality and thicker than i have imagined  good for fall  maybe a little warm for the hot humid summer days  but perhaps a cooler summer day. unfortunately this dress runs pretty large  much too large for my petite frame  so i had to return it. i would recommend sizing down. this dress is very beautiful and would be great to wear to work or out for after work drinks  also maybe a bridal shower or other brunch event.",Dresses
0,"Pros: material is amazing  super soft and quality thickness (but not like uber this  just enough  it will last). also seems like it won't wrinkle much which would make it a great dress to throw in a bag for a trip. fits well in the shoulders  chest and the length is good.    cons: the ""waist"" line is really tight and really really high. i'm 5'8""  150lbs and my usual medium is pretty tight. of course it hits me on the rib cage too  which is so weird. it's way higher than it should be.    i'll pro",Dresses
0,This dress is so cute and so flattering. i loved the shape  but i wore it wonce and the fabric was pulling on everything! just holding a purse while walking managed to pull out a ton of the fabric! when you spend so much money on something you think the quality would be better..,Dresses
0,Just a warning  the yoke on this dress has sequins underneath. i'm not a sparkle kinda gal  so as soon as i saw that  the dress went right back in the package and will be going back to the store. i wish that had been described or more evident in the pictures  to me  it cheapens the whole dress  which would otherwise be adorable.,Dresses
0,The dress has a flattering cut and is a nice color. but  the fabric looks like old  matted carpet. i will be returning.,Dresses
0,"So the dress is interesting. has an asymmetrical wrap look  short  sexy length (i'm 5'3"" and the petite barely covers my assets)  and a neckline that implies sexy without actually displaying the girls- it crosses over and stays closed  but looks sexy and plunging. but the shoulders are what make it look matronly. they're wide- from neck out to the outer edge of my shoulder/upper arm. they show no shoulder at all  which is really an odd design when the rest of the dress is sexy-ish. i looked back",Dresses
1,This dress is even more beautiful in person. it fits true to size and drapes nicely from the body without being tent-like  as some swing dresses are prone to be. the material is very nice and the pattern is stunning and unique. as someone else mentioned  you can pair this with a cardi for work. it's also perfect for a night out. it's easily dressed up or down. and looks amazing with a skinny belt. i'm happy i bought this one!,Dresses
1,"The material is nice and has a lot of stretch. i ordered the small as i'm a 6 in most dresses. it fits comfortably  i could probably get away with xs but have a large chest so was afraid it wouldn't cover me. i'm 5'2"" so a petite might be a bit better but it was sold out. i'll have to wear tall wedges with this one.",Dresses
1,I saw this in stores and ran right up to it because of the gorgeous embroidery work and vivid colors - unfortunately those bright colors are totally washed out in the online model pics...barely recognizable! the fabric itself is super soft and not at all stiff  plus it has pockets! i can see this looking great with leggings and boots  but the sleeves flared a little too much which i think would add bulk under a cardigan  so it might not carry as far into cooler months as i would like. my usual s,Dresses
1,Stumbled upon this dress which had been returned to a store and was encouraged to try it on by the sales staff  and am glad i did. it's a beautiful dress that i didn't need and have no idea what i will wear it for  but bought anyway. i got a size 8 and it fits perfectly though i will need to shorten it a bit. i am busty and prefer a bit more coverage so will add more tulle to the v neck. i agree with the other reviewer about the tulle underlay but it looks easy enough to remove from the lining o,Dresses
1,Omg!! i just received this dress and it is absolutely gorgeous!! fits me like a glove. lovely rich reds and quality..... for reference i'm 5'2 and 99 lb and the 00 petite was perfect i could have even gone with the 00 regular. if it's within your means i highly recommend. :d,Dresses
1,"As other reviewers have mentioned  this dress runs extremely large. i'm a solid medium in maeve dresses usually and got this dress in the store in a size x-small... and took it to my local seamstress to get it taken in! i get that this is supposed to be a ""swingy"" and ""airy"" dress but there was just too much space and material for me. i loved the top and the soft material so i am ok with spending money to get the waist taken in. i think this would be the perfect dress for someone with a slim fig",Dresses
1,I really love this this dress  but i agree with the previous reviewer about the belt around the waist-it is a draped piece of fabric that is very figure flattering where it wraps  but one side of the dress has no belt and it shows muffin tops/bulges.i would have loved this if the belt went all the way around. one other point i would like to make is that bra straps are hard to conceal. i bought this dress because of the gorgeous color  but ended up returning it because of the belt and bra strap i,Dresses
1,This dress is a vintage 20s drop hem style  not meant to be tight to form.  that said  the bottom is loose so may want to size down.  5'2  145 lbs= s.  i bought the neutral- navy pattern and it is absolutely gorgeus!  hints of peach and beautiful lace detail.  i literally got compliments all day long- from friends and strangers.  i paired it with a dark denim jacket.  absolute must have for sale price.,Dresses
1,Dress is wonderfully made. the fabric is soft and the print is beautiful.wonderful detail especially the ties.  nice lining...not see thru at all.  mid calf length looks good with heels or flats.  lovely dress for a sunny day or an evening out!!,Dresses
-1,I was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately it's going back because the knit is just too thin. i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but it's not. and because it's so light  the swing effect doesn't really come off. nothing special.,Fine gauge
-1,I know this is supposed to look oversized  and i own a few oversized ponchos  but this takes oversized to a whole new level.  i ordered it in my usual size and it was just waaaaay too much fabric - i do not think sizing down would have made a difference.  if you are looking for that  it seemed like good qualify.,Fine gauge
-1,I was really excited about this sweater  but the fit was terrible. the sleeves were the right size  but the body of the sweater was a tent - absolutely no shape. they must have clipped the sweater on the model. for reference  i'm 5'4 and 120 pounds and ordered a size small.,Fine gauge
-1,The sweater material was really soft and seemed well-made. the back is an interesting twist  but the material creases easily; i can see it looking messy by the end of the day. the main reason i returned it though was because it runs very large. i got my usual s  and i could have sized down 1  maybe even 2 sizes. i didn't like it enough to try a smaller size.,Fine gauge
-1,As soon as you get up close to this sweater  you will notice that the bird on the front is of an interesting kind of material-almost like carpet that has been shaved waaaaaaaay down so that the little fibers are sticking straight up and a fraction of a millimeter high. i was not excited about this texture and can imagine it will be a huge magnet for collecting lint and dust throughout the day. the fit was way off on this one for me and was not flattering at all. it wasn't for me at all even thou,Fine gauge
-1,The pattern and fabric are lovely  but the sleeves are short (unlike the photo) so it drapes very strangely. i personally could not figure out how to wear it so that it looked anything remotely like the photo. had to return this one.,Fine gauge
-1,"Loved this top online but when i tried it on it was shorter than expected so only fitting for high waisted bottoms and much more boxy than it appeared online. i wish to high heaven that this top came in a more ""normal"" cut. hip length and slimming  the fabric and collar are beautiful!",Fine gauge
-1,I saw this on a mannequin in the store and so wanted it to work but was just too oversized and bulky. very good quality and material.,Fine gauge
-1,Got this in purple and love it! ordered red and silver and only received red so far  but had to return because it was oddly shaped and didn't fit well like the purple. not sure what happens. maybe miss sized?,Fine gauge
0,"Just got this in the mail yesterday and i want so badly to love it but it's just a little too big and boxy. i'm 5'5""  125lbs and ordered a small but i really wish i'd ordered the xs. not sure if i'll exchange or just return. seems high quality and the pattern is gorgeous. it's basically exactly what i'm looking for until i actually put it on and then it just kind of looks like i'm wearing my grandpa's old sweater.",Fine gauge
0,I ordered the pink  and it was gorgeous. the color and feel were so soft  i would have kept it if it were a blanket. but i did send it back because as a sweater  it just didn't lay right. it has a sort of inside layer that just didn't fit right with the outside sweater layer  so it ended up puffing up on the sides at the waist. that was not flattering. and the hood was too large and floppy looking. too bad.,Fine gauge
0,I bought this sweater in dark grey in the store. i really loved it at first - it's very soft and cozy and fits really well. i especially like that it's long enough to cover my tummy and butt when i wear skinny jeans or leggings. however  the other reviews that mention it gets fuzz all over the place are accurate. i doubt i would have bought this if i had read them first. it even has dark grey fuzz in the inside of the sleeves. however  my biggest disappointment is that after just one wearing  th,Fine gauge
0,This is a thick sweater. it is pretty  but has a short length.,Fine gauge
0,I love this sweater  so why a lower rating? while i love the material and the color  it lost all of its shape before i even left the house! i am a size 6 / small and it looked clownish on me before i ever got to my dinner party.  i plan to wash it this evening and i really hope that this brings it back to its original shape and keeps it.,Fine gauge
0,I really like the idea behind this top  but at least for me  the execution wasn't quite there. i was hoping it would be something i could wear to work  but the sheerness of the sides makes it in appropriate for my workplace (when it gaps/you move  you can see a lot). if you don't move  the front panel is pretty opaque  which is good. i think it would look odd with a cami underneath and i don't feel comfortable with the sheerness  so i returned it. i also thought the finish on the sleeves looked,Fine gauge

0,I usually wear petite which this was not so a little big for me. but nice color and good quality  but pricey for what it is. it's more like a $45 sweater not $100+,Fine gauge
0,I really wanted to love this sweater after reading the reviews but when i received it i was sadly disappointed. it is pretty boxy and not much shape. could be cute for casual outfits but i was looking for some dressier sweaters.,Fine gauge
1,I'm happy with this sweater! a few things that may help others: 1) the detail on the yoke is made from a silky taupe-colored fiber  2) it is ivory  not white and 3) although the fit is true to size  the sweater runs short  so if you prefer a longer fit you may want to size up.,Fine gauge
1,I love the black and grey version of the vest but decided too try it in plum. the plum color is used only on the lapels and inside of the garment. it has no finished seams but it is like a soft boiled wool so it wouldn't ravel. the seam in the waistline area breaks up the design and adds more interest.,Fine gauge
1,So soft  high quality  perfect poncho sweater that will go with every pair of jeans you have. love!,Fine gauge
1,Yes  it is big. but it is also amazing. so soft  the colors are great  and the hood  well  the hood makes it. great colors for fall. it's a poncho. it's not supposed to be fitted. i'll be wearing this all fall through winter. love it.,Fine gauge
1,Great flow and and spring color. short waisted and fit wonderfully. i can see how long waisted people would have an issue.,Fine gauge
1,I ordered my normal size large and am sadly returning because it's overly large and long on my frame. the slight dolman sleeves are too long and wide and better suited for longer arms than mine. love the pointelle sleeves. they add a soft feminine vibe. hard to tell from the photos  but the texture is almost fuzzy.  the gray color is beautiful and  its actually made from multi colored beige and gray that looks silver in the light. it doesn't itch or shed. i don't like it enough to try a smaller,Fine gauge
1,I just bought this in the yellow and am very pleased!!! the sleeves are super long but i'm happy about that! usually  they are much too short  this is much cozier! this will look cute over dresses and with jeans and a longer/tunic style top. nice quality too,Fine gauge
1,This is a 3-season item that can function as a cardigan or a jacket and will look equally good with jeans or with work slacks. the seaming gives it a bit of structure. the asymmetrical zipper gives it a little twist. the texture gives it interest. i bought it in navy and i'm considering the ivory.,Fine gauge

-1,Fun  sexy underwear but rides up in the front. will return,Intimates
-1,I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. it's soft and fits okay  but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store  i would have passed over it. however  i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies  though!,Intimates
0,This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one,Intimates
0,I wanted to love these because they are so pretty and come in lots of colors  but after only a few minutes of wearing them  i was having to pull them out of my bottom! why does women's underwear so frequently ride up? i normally wear a size 4/28  and ordered these in a m  but i guess they were still too small  which seems unreasonable to me. they are soft and pretty  but i will not be ordering more.,Intimates
0,I have been eyeing this piece for months now! i broke down and bought it when they finally had my size in stock. i am 5 '4 and 110 lbs and have a very small chest so i ordered an xs. i think the top is too baggy for me. yes  the top and bottoms fit overall  but it doesn't look as nice and form fitting like it does on the model. it is very sheer--which is the thing that discourages me the most. i love the concept of this piece but the execution could use some work  which i am willing to work on s,Intimates
0,I ordered this in black and white  thinking you can never have enough silk camisoles.     i returned the black because it looked like polyester. the white is actually a cream/ivory  not bright white as pictured. it is also not the best feeling quality  however the fit is good  and true to size.,Intimates
0,I really was looking forward to this piece but unfortunately it was too small to even pass through my head nevertheless i couldn't even get both arms in. i got a size small and probably needed a large; but as far as the quality and color  it's really pretty! just go up a size or two if anything and try it out.,Intimates
0,When ordering this product  i thought it was strange that the mediums were sold out. i went with the small which is generally what i wear. however  these run small and i see why the medium ran out. they are pretty  however  i wish they made them more true to size.,Intimates
0,Got this in the mail today and while the design is cute  it's not as soft and comfortable as i would like. the front clasp takes a bit of practice to get on and off. the straps are a bit thin and hurts a bit.,Intimates

1,I got the burgundy color and i do have to say that the color looks a little better online than it does in person  but it's not too much of a difference. this is a really cute thong  and if you're just trying to be sexy/romantic  then i think it would be fine and there's nothing at all wrong with it. however  i like to wear thongs just in general because i think they're comfortable and i like not having to worry about panty lines  and this is definitely not the most comfortable. the front pattern,Intimates
1,This piece fits true to size and is very flattering on. sometimes i worry about my stomach not being perfectly flat  but this wasn't an issue at all  probably because of the intricate lace details. the fabric is substantial enough that i don't feel like it'll get a hole in it after multiple wears.,Intimates
1,I do wish this came in a 30dd sizing  purchased he 32d and it fits  though the band is looser than desired. i am still keeping it. i love the back  will be great for some of my dresses ti used to wear strapless bras to wear. recommend.,Intimates
1,"I ordered size small. i am 5' 6""  32 b. the fabric is super soft and the fit is great. there's an adorable little quote on the pantie's lining  and the bra has a beautiful print on its inner lining. the feel of the lace and fabric is divine. love it! one more thing to note...there is very little lining in the bra; really nothing more than an extra layer of fabric. it is enough to protect modesty  but not much else.",Intimates
1,Oh how i love this bra!! its so comfortable and very flattering. i find that many bralettes totally flatten me out but this one does not. and the floral lace here is just beautiful. the daisy-type flowers look so cute and feminine! i've got it in so many colors now. for sizing  i'm 34b and the s/m fits great.,Intimates
1,This is the perfect bralette for comfort; it's soft and fits to form really quickly. i wear a b cup  and it's enough support for me to wear daily doing everything other than heavy exercise. now  at 5 months pregnant it's pretty much perfect to sleep in too. i'm at 35 band  and i'm still wearing it on the loosest closure  but it fits perfectly there for me.,Intimates
1,While there us no clasp and this bra does require you to pull it over your head  i did not find it to be too difficult. i love that the bra stays in place and that i do not have to constantly pull it up throughout the day! it's quite comfortable too. i wish i had ordered the same bra with the straps too before they sold out of my size!,Intimates
1,Beautiful nightie- looks like its really well made and fits really well. i'm normally a size 6-8 and the m was perfect. definitely recommend.,Intimates
-1,"I know this product description says oversized but that's an understatement. i ordered a small and tried it on and i looked like a little kid in their father's jacket. i don't even think an xs would have worked. i'm 5'6"" and about 135 pounds for reference. i will say that the embroidery on the back is very cool and this jacket is overall a cool concept but it's just way too big.",Jackets
-1,Read the reviews and thought i would just remove the label asap to prevent snags since i loved the item!   however  the item came with unrepairable holes  not just snags and they are either on the neck or front sleeve which forces me to return the item asap. didn't even try it on. so sad  but i still love retailer!!!,Jackets
-1,I bought this online in the grey and blue and had high hopes. it runs big so size down at least 1-2 sizes. i didn't realize that the sweater looking part on the forearms was part of the coat. that part of the coat is really nice and comfy. unfortunately  the rest of the coat (the wool part) is very itchy. it would've been awesome if it was lined on the inside  but it's not...so i'm taking them back.,Jackets
-1,This is a beautiful kimono but just isn't made well. the one i received already had a couple small holes and a pull in the thread that was very noticeable. after reading the additional reviewer who wore it an hour and it was already pilling  it is going back for good. such a shame!,Jackets
-1,This is a beautiful vest. i love the color-blocking  the modern and structured style  and its versatility.  i bought it with a defective item discount because there were some stains. i promptly took it to the dry cleaners and was informed that the black would bleed onto the white paneling if they did a full wash. they spot-cleaned it  and it did bleed. although the tag says to dry clean this baby  the black dye will bleed to the white fabric. i'll be taking it back into the store today for a ref,Jackets
-1,The color is completely off! i loved the way this vest looks in the picture! i was excited to have that vest but unfortunately what i received in the mail was a huge disappointment. it came wrinkled and the brown is not as rich as it is in the picture. very pale. horrible.,Jackets
-1,This is not a kimono. it's a cocoon. there's a huge difference.  it's also not made very well.,Jackets
-1,I was leery of purchasing this blazer online without any reviews to read...and now i know better. the color and fabric are nice and what you would expect from the photos. the sleeves  however  ran small compared to the body. the shoulders also pulled and felt narrow compared to the torso. the body the opposite...too large and not flattering on an hourglass figure...no darts  no fitted places  nothing making it tailored to fit. open it hung wide with an unflattering silhouette. buttoned  it sprea,Jackets
-1,Even at a very deep discount  this piece is definitely not worth the money. the picture made me think this jacket had a longer curved velvet hem as part of its design (which would be cool)--which is largely what attracted me to it  but as i discovered when it arrived  that was actually part of the shirt worn beneath in the photo. so this image is rather misleading. the actual jacket is very thin--more like a shirt with an open front than a jacket. the pockets are just loosely tacked inside. for,Jackets
0,Has i read the reviews would have realized the t-shirt looking sleeves in the pic are attached to the sweater. based on the pic and site description i didnt realize they were attached. i thought it was part of the styling of the undershirt. i think this very much limits the versatility of the sweater. i ordered the white which is a beautiful color and very soft. i am returning it cause i do not like the t-shirt sleeve. would rather have the flexibility to layer whatever shirt i wanted,Jackets
0,Well made but strange fit. the medium was long and narrow  waaay too small.,Jackets
0,Ordered this vest in both the xs and pxs. i liked the length and overall fit of the xs  however  i ended up returning both due to how the vest draped. the outer fabric is a bit more stiff which made the vest balloon out more then what i liked. overall  it?s not a terrible vest but just not for me.,Jackets
0,I've been looking at this jacket on line and finally went to the store to try it on. i really liked the styling but the denim was quite stiff. i'd prefer a softer kind of fabric. i wonder if it would soften if it was washed. also  it ran surprisingly small. i usually take an xsmall or small but the small didn't leave me enough room to comfortably bend my arms. the medium worked better. i wonder how others feel about the fabric and and the sizing. i think i'll wait and see if this one goes on sal,Jackets
0,If you have any curves at all then this will look like a sack on you. i wanted to love it because of the material and i've been looking for a blazer/ jacket that was heavy in weight. this just looked awful on me. maybe for someone who is very slender this will work but i was highly disappointed in the cut.,Jackets
0,When i tried it on it looked like a stiff bathrobe. straight  too boxy.,Jackets
0,"I really  really wanted to love this jacket. unfortunately  i have a long torso and it was a weird length on me. it hit touching my waist and i wanted something a little longer. i am 5'6""  but long waisted. this probably fits beautifully on someone more short-waisted or petite in stature. it was beautiful (although the buttons were cheap...)",Jackets
0,I'm 5'6''   athletic build-thought it was cute but in the end didn't like the color of the inner sweatshirt--wish it was black or white. send it back.,Jackets
0,The fit is quite strange on me as the tie is very high on the waist. this makes the jacket look odd and quite voluminous. i was very impressed with the fabric though but will have to return. i wish retailer would post what size is the model wearing. maybe she is wearing a larger size than usual which falls lower.,Jackets
1,Love this sweater/jacket. fit is good and the colors are just right  not to bright and not boring. the shawl color takes a wee bit of adjusting but is worth the extra minute or so. also has a hood built into shawl that when not in use can not be seen  very cool. have worn it a couple of times and always get compliments.,Jackets
1,"The fabric is so thin  i think this entire garment might actually fit in a normal-sized letter envelope. the problem is not going to be that the garment is see-through (which it is) - it's the fact that the super thin fabric is not silky  it's cotton-ey  and i suspect it will get ""stuck"" against the back of my shirt/pants while i'm wearing it and not drape nicely. i wonder if some tiny weights could be sewn to the bottom hem to keep it laying properly.....    however  i'm such a sucker for a pre",Jackets
1,I really like the look of this jacket  but i think it runs small and i must return the one i received. i am debating about ordering the next size up because it is so cute. it can go with jeans or khakis and bright or white shirt underneath. it seems very versatile. will be a good transition piece between seasons. i also like that it is made in the usa.,Jackets
1,I love this kimono. it fits great. and is gorgeous!!,Jackets
1,"This is a very stylish and unique trench. it does run a bit large as i am usually a medium in jackets  but needed a small for this one. i am 5'2""   120 lbs.  but with a large chest. i think it's very flattering. i have small hips  but the large pockets do not make me look bigger. it arrived very wrinkled  but i just touched it up with an iron. i think the color is more of a taupe-gray and will go with everything. love it!",Jackets
1,Wasn't too sure about this jacket when i got it in the mail - seemed a little boxy on - maybe a smaller size would've worked better but i want to be able to layer. however  i'm keeping it because it's versatile  i love the contrast of the front/back and the buttons on the sleeve (which actually button and un-button  meaning they aren't just for show and the sleeves can be easily rolled up). a great basic jacket with some neat details.,Jackets
1,Just beautiful! the details and the colors are combined in such an usual and chic way. the fit is really comfortable too--i found that the jacket runs tts  maybe even a bit large  but i purchased my regular size so that i could wear layers. keep in mind  i have a rather large bust  so someone with a smaller one could probably size down. please note  there are no closures in the front of the jacket  but it looks almost closed when you're wearing it.,Jackets
1,"I received this jacket in the mail today. i wasn't sure of my size so i ordered the s & m. i opened the medium first and found that to fit me well. i never tried the small on. fyi  i am 5'5""  125 lbs. & 34a in the chest. it allowed some ""give"" room for layering  like the picture of the model. this is a very cute jacket  no doubt about it. i like the combo of the linen with the leather. the outside of the jacket is well constructed. the reason i put 4 stars and said ""but"" is because of the unfini",Jackets
1,I purchased this jacket in green  x-small a while back and wasn?t 100% sure about it due to the size. i?m 5?3?  117 lbs and a 33a and thought it was a little snug so i tried on the small and that was way too big so i kept the xs. i have worn it a few times and it does look great however i can only wear thin tops with it. recently i purchased the black  x-small and this i love. it?s looser then the green so i can get away with thicker tops.   i do recommend both jackets. they are pricey for what,Jackets
-1,"These pants are more like 9"" not 10"". i was very dissappointed. the color is great and so is the fabric.  if you look more closely at the model the pants don't fit her either!! they are too small! i haven't decided whether or not to take them back because i am losing weight. i am a 31 so far but these pants are like a 30. i need the color because they go perfectly with a top i bought from retailer",Jeans
-1,I really wanted to love these because i love my other steps  but they did not feel or fit the same way at all. i was also disappointed to see that they are cream and not white. these jeans feel stiffer than other stets i own and the waist was huge on me. sadly  these will be going back.,Jeans
-1,As a tall girl  i was thrilled to see that these pants come in longs! they are amazing for dressing up (or sassing up) and outfit. i anxiously anticipated their arrival and wore them the very first night i bought them. however  as someone previously mentioned the quality is poor. after wearing them to they symphony  the knee tore while i was sitting in my seat! i really don't see a way to avoid this from happening since i had not moved. i'm sooo upset because i absolutely loved these pants!,Jeans
-1,I ordered these a size up because i'd just had a baby and knew i needed a bigger size. my pre-pre baby size (chubby phase) were size 8/29. these fit like a size 4. way too small. very disappointed!,Jeans
-1,I loved them on when i got them  but they literally frayed apart on my body as i wore them  and i had them on no more than 5 times. it was not a fit issue or a seam issue; they literally just frayed apart in two areas.  while flattering and incredibly comfortable  the fabric was not at all durable...they are not your typical  denim   they almost kind of a knit feel them.,Jeans
-1,Bummer  i fell in absolute love with these gems until i realized how weak the stretch is by the end of the day. i purchased them on the 13th of feb and can't bare to wear them anymore.,Jeans
-1,I loved the look of these pants in the pictures online and i loved the way that they fit. however when i got my pair  the flower placement was completely different. the whole front was black and there were just flowers running out of the crotch seams. i ordered another pair hoping they were just cut wrong  but those were even worse. they looked obscene.,Jeans
-1,So after reading the 2 reviews  decided to just order my usual size (26)  thinking they might be a tad snug. wrong! they were huge! i looked at the size to see if they sent me a size 30 by mistake! unfortunately small sizes sold out. quality is excellent as well as style  so bummed!,Jeans

0,I have been looking for a quality pair of black skinny jeans for a while. after reading the reviews  i had such high hopes for these jeans. i bought it in my usual size 28 and while the top part fit perfectly  i found that the bottom was too tapered in and ultra skinny making it not look right. sadly  i had to return.,Jeans
0,I am a pretty consistent size 2 or 26. ordered these in my usual 26 and  yikes  right out of the package knew they''d be way to small. they have a lot of stretch in them so i was able to get them buttoned but they were wayyyy too small and looked awful. i returned them for a 27 which i am still waiting for. i'll update this review when they arrive. other than the size issue  they were just as pictured/expected.,Jeans
0,I had high hopes for these as coh is my favorite brand of denim  and these crops were made specifically for petites. also  i was happy to see they were described as a straight jean  not a skinny. the fit and sizing seems to be a little off. i ordered my regular size in this brand  27p  but they were too big. sized down to a 26p. they were still too large in the waist (seemed very stretchy) but fit well in the legs. i like the fact that these crops were made for petites so the length was perfect ,Jeans
0,Nice soft jeans  cute style  and i wish i could keep them...they just are too small on me. :/ not sure if i've gained weight (which i don't think i have because i had on a size 28 pair of pants today) but i ordered a size 29 in these jeans and they zipped but just too snug around the waist. i would honestly need a 30 or 31. looks like they are selling out quickly so i doubt i'll be able to get the size i need.   if you have a small waist i think they would be fine but they don't fit my body type,Jeans
0,I absolutely love the fit of these jeans! they are perfect in length and fit nicely on the hips. they are fitted and look nice with boots  but they do not feel tight at all because of the legging material. legging material  while comfortable  typically feels thin  but these do not and they are quite warm.  the one major drawback is that the pants have pilled on the thighs. i have had these pants for about 1.5 months now and i have washed them (and have hang dried them) about 4 times. i have neve,Jeans

1,I just wore these for the first time and they are so comfortable. the mid rise waist is not too tight as many jeans are on me and the fitted hips keeps the wide leg crop cut from being frumpy. i wore them with sandals and i think they will wear well with booties and boots as the weather gets cooler too. they are a substantial weight jean not just for summer. these jeans will be seeing a lot of wear.,Jeans
1,"The perfect pair. i am 5'6"". 130lb  and ordered size 28  and it fits just right. it is a little stretchy  so molds to your shape. the legs are slender  but not too fitted. no stitching along the seems makes these jeans classy enough to work with a dressy shirt.",Jeans
1,I love these jeans! you can dress them up or down.,Jeans
1,I love the color and cut of the pants. they are more a dark indigo twill than a jean  to be sure. a fit issue is how the front pockets pop out because of the excessive stretchiness of the fabric. i wear them and love them  but stitched the front pockets closed to avoid the unflattering pop-out pockets.,Jeans
1,These are a different take on the white jean. thick enough that you don't see undies. cool lace detail on the ankles. i have very long legs  so they hit me a little higher than described. i did undo the laces a bit to give them a little kick at the bottom. i love the fit of the plico jean. i own a few pairs and they sit just high enough on my waist so when you bend over your bottom doesn't peek out. i usually wear a 27  and they aren't too tight and have a bit of stretch  but don't loose their s,Jeans

0,This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.,Layering

0,"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",Layering
0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,Layering

1,I was not expecting the material to be as thick as it is. it has a wonderful drape and hand to it. i love the string tie straps so i can adjust it to fall on my chest a little higher. it seems that everything is too low-cut for my modest taste  but the ties let you decide how much cleavage to show. finding the right bra is always a little bit of a challenge with a cami  but i usually wear them under sweaters and jackets  so i'm not terribly concerned.,Layering
1,Love this tank! prettier shade of yellow in person. love the strap width and length. wish they'd bring back more in lots of colors. i sized up one from my usual size and will have to shorten the length of the strap myself  but it's an easy alteration and is totally worth it! especially good at sale price. i really hope they make more in the style in lots of colors. great find!,Layering
1,There's something special about this tank that makes it uber-flattering. the fabric is perfect  the colors (green and fuchsia) are spot-on gorgeous and brightening  and the cut (length  wide straps  and scooped neckline) make this the perfect staple. it flattered my figure  skin color  and really hid my flaws. i wish i could get away with wearing this every day...,Layering

-1,"I ordered these because of the side zipper  but they zip in front  even though the order listing and bag label called them ""wine  side zip pants."" they were also at least two sizes larger than marked and very flimsy material. what bothers me is that i was charged $5.95 to send them back  even though the product description (and the name before someone changed it on the website) were wrong.",Pants
-1,I loved the cut and the stretch in the material made them comfortable  however i found that the material was unflattering for thicker thighs because it tended to cling to the body. it would have been better with some sort of lining as it would have prevented the flimsy material from highlighting imperfections. bottom of pants are not hemmed  so if you want a clean look  you may not like the edges. these were returned immediately as it just did not work for me.,Pants
-1,First  the good parts: these are adorable in person and (i think) the colors are prettier in person than in the pictures. the green isn't too army green  it's a pretty nice mellow neutral that you could wear with reds  whites  blues  pinks...virtually any color.  the tencel fabric is super soft and comfortable and the drape is nice. they do seem to run a little large  so i'd size down if you're between sizes.  and now  sadly  the bad: these stretch out virtually an entire size after just about a,Pants

-1,Just recently purchased and think it's ok for the price. would never pay full on this one & that's from an retailer shopper who's purchased plenty at full price. design is cute but definitely looks like a sleep shirt esp in the lighter color  so-so on construction - the bottom seams pucker slightly  the pockets bunch up weirdly (steaming/laundering don't help) & the shoulders also hunch up oddly. could be because of the thicker fabric sewn to the knit but laundering didn't help that issue either.,Sleep

1,This dress is just lovely. beautiful drape  comfortable material. it is a print that looks like embroidery. i am usually an xs or s  and i'm glad i got the xs as i can tell the s would have been too large. the back waistband is elastic and it is easy to move in. beautiful neutral colors. i think it can be dressed up or down easily with the right shoes and jewelry. only negative comments- there is only a half slip and i wish it was lined more  although that will make it easier to wear during the,Trend
1,I love this tunic! it's wool but the same kind of thin high quality wool you might find in a nicer scarf. colors are much nicer than they show up online. this is one you really need to see in person. the only drawback is that the material seems to snag easily. i returned the top at full price as it is just too much to spend for something i'll only wear a few times before no doubt ruining it. if you are not hard on your clothes like i am  this is a great find. i may repurchase it when/if it gets,Trend
1,This easel caftan is simply amazing! the silhouette fits all sizes and shapes while providing a unique dress.,Trend
